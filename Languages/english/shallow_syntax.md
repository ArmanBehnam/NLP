# Shallow syntax

Shallow syntactic tasks provide an analysis of a text on the level of the syntactic structure 
of the text.

## Chunking

Chunking, also known as shallow parsing, identifies continuous spans of tokens that form syntactic units such as noun phrases or verb phrases.

Example:

| Vinken | , | 61 | years | old |
| --- | ---| --- | --- | --- |
| B-NLP| I-NP | I-NP | I-NP | I-NP |

### Penn Treebank

The [Penn Treebank](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC99T42) is typically used for evaluating chunking.
Sections 15-18 are used for training, section 19 for development, and and section 20
for testing. Models are evaluated based on F1.

## Resolving the Scope and focus of negation

Scope of negation is the part of the meaning that is negated and focus the part of the scope that is most prominently negated (Huddleston and Pullum 2002).

Example:

`[John had] never [said %as much% before].`

Scope is enclosed in square brackets and focus marked between % signs.

The [CD-SCO (Conan Doyle Scope) dataset](https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/sem2012-st-neg/data.html) is for scope detection.
 The [PB-FOC (PropBank Focus) dataset](https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/sem2012-st-neg/data.html) is for focus detection.
The public leaderboard is available on the [*SEM Shared Task 2012 website](https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/sem2012-st-neg/results.html).
